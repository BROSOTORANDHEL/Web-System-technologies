        <p>Confused by website terminology? If so, here’s a handy glossary (all in plain English) that’ll quickly get you up to speed and demystify the language of web technology.</p>
        <h2>Basic Anatomy Of A Website</h2>
        <p>Let’s start by defining the various parts of a website:</p>
</Article>

<article>
        <h3>Header</h3>
        <p>The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually find the logo and the site’s navigation menu.</p>
        <img src="" alt="EZ Screen">
        <h3>Pre-Header</h3>
        <p>The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Pinnacle Urgent Care">
        <h3>Favicon</h3>
        <p>A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to your website title.</p>
        <h3>Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)</h3>
        <img src="" alt="St. Clair Medical Clinic">
        <p>On mobile devices, navigation links often transform into an icon with three stacked lines—commonly called a “hamburger” menu because it resembles a side view of a hamburger.</p>
        <img src="" alt="St. Clair Medical Clinic Appointment">
        <p>For more complex websites with tons of pages, you might encounter a “mega menu.”</p>
        <img src=" " alt="Charles A. Clements, D.D.S.">
        <h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>   
        <p>Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location within a website’s hierarchy.</p>
        <h3>Website Content</h3>
        <p>When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website content goes beyond just words. </p>
        <h3>Homepage (or home page)</h3>
        <p> The <a href="">Homepage </a> — also called the front page or main page — is the starting point of most websites.</p>
<article>        
        <p>Common elements on a home page include:</p>
        <p>✔A hero area (headline and image) to grab attention.</p>
        <p>✔A navigation menu to help visitors find key pages.</p>
        <p>✔Links or sections highlighting your most important content, services, or calls to action.</p>
</article>
<article>
        <p>A common website design best practice is to link your logo to the home page.</p>
<article>        
        <h3>Homepage Hero Area (aka Feature Area aka Headline Area)</h3>
        <p>The Homepage Hero Area is the top section of a homepage that grabs your attention and introduces the site’s primary message</p>
        <p>✔A headline that clearly communicates the site’s purpose or the problem it solves.</p>
        <p>✔A sub-headline that adds supporting details or context.</p>
        <p>✔A call-to-action button to encourage visitors to take their next step, such as scheduling a consultation or exploring services.</p>
        <p>✔A visual element, such as an image, graphic, or video, that enhances the message and creates visual interest.</p>
</article>        
        <img src="" alt="MACOMB ORTOPEDICS">
        <p>The term “hero” comes from traditional print media, where it referred to the main headline and image meant to grab attention.</p>
        <h3>Slider</h3>
        <p>A slider is a feature on a website that displays a rotating series of images, like a slideshow.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Slider Photo">
        <h3>Website Content</h3>
        <p>When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website content goes beyond just words. </p>
        <h3>Alt Text</h3>
        <p>Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is a brief description added to images on a website.</p>
        <p>1. It makes websites more accessible by describing images to visually impaired users who rely on screen readers.</p>
        <p>2. It helps search engines understand what an image is about, which can improve your website’s SEO.</p>
        <h3>Sidebar</h3>
        <p>A sidebar is the narrow vertical column that appears alongside your main website content.</p>
        <img src="" alt="MarkBrinker WebPhoto">
        <h3>Sub-Footer</h3>
<article>        
        <p>The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a webpage—just above the main footer—and is consistent across your site.</p>
        <p><strong>✔Quick Contact Information:</strong> Displaying addresses or phone numbers for immediate reference.</p>
        <p><strong>✔Supplementary Navigation Links:</strong>Offering shortcuts to key pages like “About Us,” “Services,” or even “Our Locations.”</p>
        <p><strong>✔Social Media Icons: </strong>Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles. Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles.</p>
        <p><strong>✔Additional Resources:</strong>This might include links to site maps or ancillary informational pages.</p>

</article>
<article>
        <h3>Footer (The "True" Footer)</h3>
        <p>The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a webpage.</p>
        <p><strong>Copyright and Legal Disclaimers:</strong> Noting trademark rights and the copyright year.</p>
        <p><strong>Policy Links:</strong>Links to the privacy policy, terms of use, and any other legal information.</p>
        <p><strong>Site Map</strong>A detailed breakdown of the website’s structure for improved navigation and SEO.</p>
        <img src="" alt="The True Footer Photo">
</article>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>Although many people refer to both areas (i.e. sub-footer and footer) as the “footer,” they're actually two different things</p>
        <h3>Landing Page</h3>
        <p>A landing page is a specific page on your website where visitors “land” after clicking on an ad—whether it’s from Google, Facebook, or anywhere else.</p>
        <h3>Call To Action (aka CTA)</h3>
        <p>A call to action (or CTA) is a specific and direct request asking visitors to take a desired action.</p>
        <h3>Above the Fold</h3>
        <p>“Above the fold” refers to the part of a webpage you immediately see before you start scrolling.</p>
<article>        
        <h3>Blog</h3>
        <p>A blog is a type of website—or a section of a larger website—that features content published as individual posts in chronological order, like journal entries in a diary.</p>
        <p>✔Blog posts are organized chronologically, often allowing for reader interactivity through comments.</p>
        <p>✔Web pages (like the homepage, about page, or contact page) are static, not time-based, and don’t typically include comments.</p>
</article>
<article>
        <h3>Card Design (aka Tile Design or Grid-Based Design)</h3>
        <p>Card design organizes content into visually distinct “cards” or tiles, often arranged in a grid layout.</p>
        <strong>Image galleries</strong>
        <p><strong>Blog pages</strong>to showcase multiple posts</p>
        <p><strong>Sales pages</strong>to highlight features, benefits, or services</p>

        <h3>Additional Terminology Of Modern Websites</h3>
        <h4>WordPress</h4>
        <p>WordPress powers millions of websites worldwide and is one of the most popular tools for building and managing websites.</p>
<article>        
        <p>Here’s how WordPress works:</p>
        <p><strong>Themes:</strong>A WordPress theme controls how your site looks.</p>
        <p><strong>Plugins:</strong>Plugins add functionality to your site, much like apps on your phone.</p>
</article>
        <h3>WordPress Page vs. WordPress Post</h3>
        <p>This takes a bit of explaining, so I wrote a whole piece on the similarities and differences between WordPress pages and posts, which you can find <a href="">Here</a></p>
        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p>To have a website on the internet, it needs to be <strong>hosted</strong> on a web server.</p>
        <h3>Caching</h3>
        <p>Caching is the process of storing a temporary version of a website or webpage to help it <strong>load faster.</strong></p>
        <h3>Domain Name (aka URL)</h3>
        <p>A domain name is the address people type into their browser to visit a website—like Amazon.com, CNN.com, or markbrinker.com.</p>
        <h3>Domain Registrar</h3>
        <p>A domain registrar is where you purchase and register your domain name—kind of like getting a license plate for your car from the DMV.</p>
        <h3>301 Redirect</h3>
        <p>A 301 redirect is a way to permanently send visitors (and search engines) from one URL to another.</p>
        <h3>404 Error Page</h3>
        <p>A 404 error page appears when someone tries to visit a page on your website that doesn’t exist — either because the page was deleted, the URL was mistyped, or the link is broken.</p>
        <h3>DNS</h3>
        <p>DNS stands for <strong>Domain Name System. </strong>Think of it as the phone book of the internet.</p>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it’s the standard language used to create websites and web pages.</p>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
        <h3>Website Builder</h3>
        <P>A <strong>website builder</strong>is an all-in-one tool that allows you to design and build a website without needing to write code.</P>
        <h3>Mobile Responsive</h3>
        <p>A mobile responsive website automatically morphs to fit the shape and size of the screen it’s being viewed on—whether that’s a phone, tablet, or desktop. It uses CSS to adjust the layout, navigation, and font sizes seamlessly, so the site is easy to use and read on any device.</p>
        <h3>SSL</h3>
        <p>SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. </p>
<article>       
        <h3>SEO</h3>
        <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.</p>
        <ul>Is high quality and genuinely helpful.</ul>
        <ul>People actually want to read, share, or link to.</ul>
        <ul>Is properly formatted on your site (known as On-Page SEO).</ul>
</article>
        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p><a href="">Google Analytics </a> is a free service from Google that provides statistics about your website—like how many visitors you’re getting, which pages they’re viewing, and how long they’re spending on each page.</p>
<article>        
        <h3>Email Service Provider (ESP)</h3>
        <p>An<strong>email service provider</strong>(sometimes called an email management service or EMS) helps you build, manage, and communicate with your list of email subscribers.</p>
        <ul><strong>Automation: </strong>Users can add or remove themselves from your list automatically.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Scalability: </strong>Send a single broadcast email to hundreds or thousands of subscribers with just a click—something that’s nearly impossible to do manually.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Deliverability: </strong>Email service providers are “whitelisted,” so your messages are less likely to be flagged as spam.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Compliance: </strong>Helps you stay compliant with email regulations like the <a href="">CAN-SPAM Act </a>to avoid penalties.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Reporting & Tracking: </strong>See valuable stats like email open rates, link clicks, and which subject lines perform best.</ul>
