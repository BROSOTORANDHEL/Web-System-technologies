        <p><strong>T</strong>he details are not the details. They make the design,” Charles Eames once said, and that has never stopped to be true. Starting to design a web page, we have to consider what it should consist of to solve the task set for it and be both usable and beautiful</p>
<article>

        <h2>Header</h2>
        <p>Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage. Being the area people see before scrolling the page in their first seconds on the website, the header is an element of strategic importance.</p>
        <p>Headers may include a bunch of meaningful layout elements, for example:</p>
        <ul>basic elements of <a href="">brand identity</a>,usually a logo</ul>
        <ul>call-to-action button</ul>
        <ul>links to basic categories of website content</ul>
        <ul>links to the social networks</ul>
        <ul>basic contact information (telephone number, e-mail address, etc.)</ul>
        <ul>switcher of the languages in case of the multilingual interface</ul>
        <ul><a href="">search field</a></ul>
        <ul>subscription field or button</ul>
        <ul>links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from the AppStore, etc.</ul>
</article>
        <img src="" alt="Distribution like never before (Photo)">
        <p>What makes a header a vital element contributing to web usability is the fact that it is placed in the most scannable zone of a web page. Whatever is the <a href="">scanning pattern </a>users stick to on a website, it starts from the top part of the page, scanned from left to right for languages using the same reading and writing pattern. It means that what is placed in the header won’t be missed, especially the elements placed in its left and right corners. That’s why you will often find the main CTA button in one of them. What’s more, the power of habit and the idea of <a href="">external consistency</a>of user experience should also be taken into account here. For years so far, visitors have been used to finding core navigation in headers, so mostly, the main question is to decide what to put into it rather than to use a header or not.</p>
<article>
        <p>Some of the popular design practices for web headers include:</p>
        <ul><strong>hamburger menu:</strong> hiding the set of links to different pages or sections behind the <a href="">hamburger button </a>called so as it consists of horizontal lines looking like a typical bread-meat-bread hamburger.</ul>
        <ul><strong>sticky header:</strong>header that doesn’t hide away but sticks to the top part of the page when users are scrolling the page down. This way core navigation area is available at any point of interaction, which can be helpful in terms of content-heavy pages with long scrolling.</ul>
        <ul><strong>two-layer navigation</strong> a sort of double set of navigation sites in the header to separate two different routes of navigation that are both important for web usability.</ul>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic (Photo)">
</article>
        <h1>CTA Button</h2>
        <p>A<a href=""> call-to-action (CTA) button </a>is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a user to take a certain action</p>
        <img src="" alt="About ShippDaddy (Photo)">
        <p>About page for  <a href="">ShipDaddy website</a>is a good example of the call-to-action element instantly noticeable in the general webpage layout.</p>
        <img src="" alt="mayple (Photo)">
        <p>The web page for <a href="">Mayple </a>is formed of several sections and uses a set of consistent call-to-action buttons for each combining them effectively with the same CTA in the header, this way allowing visitors to move on from different points of their browsing the page.</p>

        <h2>Hero Section</h1>
        <p>Hero section is the above-the-fold (pre-scroll area of the web page containing the element that presents the strong visual hook) </p>

</article>

        <h2>Footer</h2>
        <p>Footer is the lower (bottom) part of the web page which usually marks its end. Being another common zone of global website navigation, the footer provides the additional field for useful links and data users may be interested in finding.</p>
        <p>Footers can include:</p>
        <ul>brand identity signs, usually the name and logo of the company or product</ul>
        <ul>links to user support sections, for example, FAQ page, About page, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, Support Team, etc.</ul>
        <ul>credits to website creators</ul>
        <ul>contact forms and information</ul>
        <ul>links to company or product accounts in social networks</ul>
        <ul>testimonials and badges</ul>
        <ul>certification signs</ul>
        <ul>subscription field or button.</ul>
        <p>As well as the header, the footer is not the element found in all websites users can come across the web.</p>

        <h2>Slider</h2>
        <p>Slider is an interactive element that applies a technique of a slideshow or carousel to present different products, offers, etc. It is especially popular as a part of <a href=""> e-commerce </a>and business websites to present a sort of gallery of products or services.</p>
        <p>Sliders present controversial interactive elements that often become an object of hot debates. Among the benefits, we could mention the following:</p>
        <ul>saving space on the page</ul>
        <ul>user engagement</ul>
        <ul>attractive visual hook</ul>
        <p>However, even though the advantages sound really good, there are also obvious pitfalls:</p>
        <ul>page speed decreasing due to slider functionality, this way influencing SEO</ul>
        <ul>display of several equal options together, which may hurt usability and get distracting as people do not observe priorities, and that makes it harder to focus</ul>
        <ul>possible problems of sliders in the mobile adaptation of the website</ul>
        <ul>as well as banners, sliders can be perceived as ads and skipped</ul>
        <p>So, deciding upon slider integration into the web layout, designers must consider all pros and cons for each particular case.</p>

        <h1>Search</h1>
        <p>Internal search is a functionality that enables a visitor to browse the content inside the website and shows it according to the search query. Tuned correctly, it shows the relevant content, and this way provides the shortcut to what the user needs. Thus, the internal search saves the user’s time and effort, amplifies usability and desirability of the digital product, helps retain users, and increases conversion rates.</p>

        <h2>Menu</h2>
        <p>The menu is one of the core navigation elements in user interfaces. It is a graphical control that presents the options of interactions with the interface. Basically, it can be the list of commands – in this case, options will be presented with verbs marking possible actions like, for example, “save,” “delete,” “buy,” “send,” etc. A menu can also present the categories along which the content is organized in the given interface, and this can be the high time for using nouns marking them.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Types of event photo">
        <p>Interactions with a menu on the event booking website</p>
        <p>Menus can be organized horizontally or vertically. Some popular types found on diverse websites are:</p>
        <ul><strong>Classic horizontal menu:</strong>the most common and well-recognized type of menu which presents the core navigation organized as a horizontal line in the website header, mentioned above</ul>
        <ul><strong>Sidebar menu: </strong>quite a classic type, presents a vertical list of options sticking to the left or right side of the web page</ul>
        <ul><strong>Dropdown menu: </strong> a more complex type of menu for content-heavy websites; here, the list of additional options opens below the primary one when it’s clicked or hovered. Another similar option is the dropup menu, when the list opens up, not down, but the essence is the same.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Megamenu: </strong>that’s the complex expandable menu in which the big list of multiple choices is presented in a two-dimensional dropdown layout; this approach is effective for cases with a vast number of options.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Hamburger menu: </strong>when the hamburger button (typically marked with three horizontal lines) is clicked, the menu expands. This option saves space and is often applied to mobile versions of websites.</ul>
        <img src="" alt="Cyril soft opticals blue block">
        <p>The e-commerce website selling glasses uses the vertical menu with primary navigation in the top left corner of the page.</p>

        <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
        <p><a href="">Breadcrumbs</a>are navigation elements used to support users in a journey around the website: they get aware of where they are on the website and can get used to the website structure more easily. So, breadcrumbs present a tool for better wayfinding, yet, they don’t replace the primary navigation menu; they present the secondary level of navigation and increase website usability in case it has lots of pages.</p>
        <p>Some of the benefits of breadcrumbs are:</p>
        <ul><strong>increased findability: </strong>breadcrumbs give users another touchpoint to the content and help to catch the structure of the website</ul>
        <ul><strong>fewer clicks needed:</strong>with breadcrumbs, website visitors can jump from one level of the hierarchy to any previous step with no effort and no need to take all the way back</ul>
        <ul><strong>effective use of screen space:</strong>crafted well, breadcrumbs take a narrow horizontal line with plain-looking text elements that don’t need much space</ul>
        <ul><strong>no misinterpretation:</strong>breadcrumbs are hardly ever misunderstood by users: the behavior pattern for them has solidified through years, and people rarely mistake this element for anything else</ul>
        <ul><strong>lower bounce rate:</strong>breadcrumbs are a great support for first-time visitors or people that have no everyday experience of dealing with complex websites, so the more confident they feel, the slimmer is the chance of them bouncing the page.</ul>
        <p>As well as with internal website search, breadcrumbs are helpful in cases when the website has multiple pages and a complex hierarchy consisting of multiple layers. Breadcrumbs are common – and expected by users – in big e-commerce websites and platforms, media and news websites, blogs, and magazines covering a wide range of topics, etc. Yet, if that’s not your case and your website has a simple hierarchy, primary navigation will be enough to let the users effectively interact with it.</p>

        <h2>Form</h2>
        <p>Form is an interactive element that allows users to send information to the system or server. In a nutshell, it is a digital version of any real paper form we have to fill in to provide someone with the arranged information; however, digital forms can have more options and functionality to make this process even more smooth, clear, and user-friendly. As it is a traditional and well-recognized pattern of collecting the data, users deal with forms quite often in their digital lives, starting from the process of registration, adding personal or financial details, making payments, sending feedback, subscribing to a newsletter, etc.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Become vertt Driver today">
        <p>The landing page for <a href="">vrett</a>features a simple and visually defined form, allowing visitors to leave their phone numbers and apply for a drive.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p>This page of the ecotourism website features a contact form with which visitors can tune their search.</p>

        <h2>Cards</h2>
        <p>Cards, also called tiles, are layout elements that help arrange and visualize homogeneous data or content in a scannable and easy-to-use way. Cards are usually organized in a sort of grid, but each card looks like a separate piece in this system.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p>The Chinese restaurant website uses an irregular grid of cards to present the menu of the restaurant.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p>Art Institute blog uses ultra-minimalistic cards, separated only by negative space but organized clearly to be distinguished.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p>On the plant shop website, cards help to organize the options of related items.</p>

        <h2>Video</h2>
        <p>Video is not a really basic part of a web page, but with the progress of web development solutions and technical abilities, we can find it more and more often on the website of different kinds these days. As mentioned in the article about video content in UX design, a catchy video crafted with an understanding of the target audience is a tool attracting customers’ attention as well as a well-checked method of informing them quickly and brightly. Video content activates several channels of perception – audio, visual, motion – simultaneously, and usually does that wrapped in telling a story. Such a combination of factors often makes a video presentation strong, emotional, and memorable.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p>The website of the service that organizes camping holidays uses video as an atmospheric visual hook in the hero section, setting the needed atmosphere in split seconds.</p>

<article>
        <h2>Progress Indicator</h2>
        <p>Progress indicator is a small but helpful element that helps the visitor to understand the current point in the general volume of information or set of actions. It is beneficial on the pages loaded with text content and supposing long scrolling, like long-read articles or guides, for example. Due to this indicator, users don’t get lost and can estimate the time needed for reading or browsing better.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p>The article page on the website devoted to famous women in history uses the progress indicator in the top part of the page to help readers understand their current position and the general amount of content ahead.</p>
</article>

<article>
        <h2>Favicon</h2>
        <p>Favicon, also known as URL icon or bookmark icon, is a special type of symbol representing the product or brand in the URL-line of the browser and in the bookmark tab. It allows users to get a quick visual connection with it while they are browsing. This interface element proved itself effective for productive website promotion and good recognizability of its visual identity. Being super small, it makes a great contribution to web usability.</p>

<article>
        <h2>Tags</h2>
        <p>That’s another element of secondary navigation level, often found in blogs and websites with plenty of homogenous content. Tag is presented with a keyword or phrase that enables users to jump directly to the items marked up with it. Tags are actually pieces of metadata that provide quick access to specific content categories, so they support navigation with the additional way of content classification. Moreover, tags are often the elements that users create by themselves, so they become an alternative to the names of categories that are fixed by the website and can’t be changed by users.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p> <a href="">Design4Users blog</a> uses tags for faster navigation not only inside the articles but also on the home page.</p>
        <img src="" alt="Tubic photo">
        <p>The bright and playful website concept for the brand of party drinks uses interactive tags to let users tune their choice of the drink they want</p>
